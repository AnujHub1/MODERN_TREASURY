              Dimitri Dadiomov, Matt Marcus, and Sam Aarons met at Kiavi,
              formerly LendingHome, where they were responsible for building and
              scaling Kiavi's payment operations platform. There, they
              recognized the massive need for modern, scalable payments
              infrastructure. This offering would serve thousands of companies
              whose dated payment systems limited their ability to support and
              connect with users, clients, and employees.
