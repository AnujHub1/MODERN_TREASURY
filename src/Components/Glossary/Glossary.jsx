              What is <Link>ACH</Link>?

              How do <Link>ACH APIs</Link> work?
            </p>
            <p>
              ACH APIs enable companies with high transaction volumes to write
              software that automates payments over the ACH network. These APIs
              make it possible to initiate, receive and track payments at scale
              by eliminating manual processes.
